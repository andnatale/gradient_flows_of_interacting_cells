# Gradient flows of interacting Laguerre cells 

Python implemenation of a particle scheme for nonlinear diffusion models of porous media type

Contains code for simulations from:

A. Natale. "Gradient flows of interacting Laguerre cells as discrete porous media flows".

## Dependencies
The dependencies to run the code can be found in `requirements.txt`. In particular, [pysdot](https://pypi.org/project/pysdot/) was used to compute the Laguerre tessellation defined via the regularized energy driving the particle dynamics.
```
    $ pip install pysdot
```
